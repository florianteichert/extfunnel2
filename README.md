# extfunnel2

A "modern" version of the archived extfunnel package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extfunnel/index.html) developed by Dean Langan and colleagues that uses ggplot2 instead of base R. Currently only supports the generation of significance contours.

This function generates an extended funnel plot with shaded contours that show the impact of a new study with a certain effect estimate and standard error (or sample size) on the conclusions of an updated meta-analysis.
