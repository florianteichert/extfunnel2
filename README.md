# extfunnel2

Inspired by the archived extfunnel package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extfunnel/index.html) developed by Dean Langan et al. The function generates an extended funnel plot with shaded contours that show the impact of a new study with a certain effect estimate and standard error (or sample size) on the conclusions of an updated meta-analysis. Uses ggplot2 instead of base R, allows specification of the meta-analytic model as well as simulation using sample size per group in addition to the standard error.
