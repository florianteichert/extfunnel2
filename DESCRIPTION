Description: Inspired by the archived extfunnel package by Langan et al. The function creates an extended funnel plot with shaded contours that show the impact of a new study with a certain effect estimate and standard error (or sample size) on the conclusions of an updated meta-analysis. Uses ggplot2 instead of base R, allows specification of the meta-analytic model as well as simulation using sample size per group.
