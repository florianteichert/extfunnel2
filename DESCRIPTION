Description: nspired by the archived \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=extfunnel}{extfunnel package} developed by \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2011.10.009}{Langan et al}. The function generates an extended funnel plot with shaded contours that show the impact of a new study with a certain effect estimate and standard error (or sample size) on the conclusions of an updated meta-analysis. Uses ggplot2 instead of base R, allows specification of the meta-analytic model as well as simulation using sample size per group.
